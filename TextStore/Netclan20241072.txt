AI agent development and Deployment in Jina AI


A leading tech firm in Europe

The client’s object was to create AI agents for his website, which the end-users will utilize for many tasks. The client had some recommendations on the models are utilized.
Created a feasible models list that complements the client’s requirement and when ahead and executed the Executor code for every model for compatibility with JinaAI deployment. After implementing Executor codes, I created a Flow to connect every executor and deployed it successfully.

There were minute challenges, such as deployment issues and Execution issues
I resolved the issues effectively after long hours of understanding the concept because JinaAI is a new growing technology that does not have many forums to solve errors and issues.
