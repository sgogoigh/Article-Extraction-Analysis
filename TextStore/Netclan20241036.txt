PowerBI REST API â€“ Fetching Dataflow and Refresh Schedules with semantic models

A leading IT & tech firm in the USA
IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS
Our client, a large enterprise, faced significant challenges in managing their Power BI dataflows, datasets, and refresh schedules across multiple workspaces. The manual processes were time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked real-time monitoring capabilities. They needed an automated solution to streamline these tasks, ensure data accuracy, and improve overall efficiency.
We developed an automated system using Python that integrated with the Power BI API to manage and monitor dataflows, datasets, and their refresh schedules. The solution provided a comprehensive overview of all workspaces, datasets, and dataflows, including detailed transaction data and refresh schedules. This system allowed the client to efficiently track and manage their Power BI environment, reducing manual effort and improving data reliability.

The automated system significantly reduced the manual effort required for managing Power BI dataflows and datasets. It improved data accuracy, provided real-time monitoring capabilities, and allowed the client to focus on data analysis and decision-making rather than data management. The solution also enhanced overall operational efficiency and reliability.
