The main challenge was creating a full payment option using stripe API. If the customer has already received a partial amount then while performing a full refund the refund amount was always greater than the balance amount
To solve the full payment option issue, we calculate the balance amount and provided that amount to the full payment event in retool
Using this apps itâ€™s easy for the client to update the email id of the customer and refund the customers client can refund into two option full payment and partial payment
