Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain

A leading healthcare tech firm in the USA


The AI chatbot is required to assist eye care patients with various tasks, including booking appointments, tracking lens order statuses, reviewing patient dues, sending statements, and answering general questions about their eye exams and the practice.
Develop and deploy a custom-trained AI chatbot using an open-source LLM model (such as Llama) to assist eye care patients. This solution will be implemented as a SaaS offering, enabling multiple hospitals and practices to utilize the chatbot. The project will include the training of the LLM model on custom data, development of APIs for dynamic data interaction, and deployment on optimized servers.
By leveraging the power of open-source LLM models and custom training, this AI chatbot will significantly enhance patient interaction and operational efficiency for eye care providers.
