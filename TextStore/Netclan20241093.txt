Design & Develop BERT Question Answering model explanations with visualization

A Leading Tech Firm in the USA


We need to use a pre-trained bert question answering model and create a notebook that has explanations of modelâ€™s working with some visuals of bertviz, allennlp and gradient values.
A notebook which has an explanation of the bert question answering model using some visualization.
Google colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Bertviz, Allennlp, Transformers
Python programming language, Deep learning, NLP, Data Visualization
Pretrained bert-base-uncased model and distilbert model (both trained on squad2 dataset)
Data visualization, Deep learning, NLP, python
Among these models we kept the best one.
